Objective: Determine whether or not the list of 23,000-ish addresses 
(http://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/finance/web_delinquent_for_publishing_9-2-15.pdf)
are within the boundaries of Mckeesport, PA. This is for my friend Sophie Reidel, an architecture student at
Carnegie Melon University.

Step 1: Turn the pdf into a spreadsheet. Sophie has Adobe Creative Cloud, so this part was easy.

Step 2: Extract Only the list of addresses as a csv (excel readable text) this will be easy to work with.

Step 2.5: Turn to JSON?

Step 3: Remove duplicate addresses(there are many) to save time when working with the geocoding cloud.

Step 4: turn into GeoJSON.

Step 5: plug into geocoding cloud script that determines if the address is in Mckeesport, PA and also if other locations show up.
